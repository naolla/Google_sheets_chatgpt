# ChatGpt Integration with Google Sheets Using Apps Script

In this project I integrated ChatGPT with Google Spreadsheets using the GPT API and Google Apps Script.



## What to create with this?

I was able to create two custom formulas, GPT_SUMMARY and GPT_SIMPLIFY. You can use GPT_SUMMARY to summarize a large passage or text into a few bullet points for easy reading. And you can use GPT_SIMPLIFY to simplify English into easy-to-read English.

You'll also create menus with access to functions that perform the same tasks as formulas.

This project shows use ChatGPT in Google Sheets with Google Apps Script. You will also be able to modify the formulas and menus to meet your own needs, such as creating CVs, social media posts, or cover letters.
